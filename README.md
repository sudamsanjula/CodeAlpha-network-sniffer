This Python script is a simple network sniffer using the Scapy library. A network sniffer is a tool that captures and analyzes network packets traveling over a network. This particular script captures Ethernet frames and IPv4 packets, displaying detailed information about each captured packet.

**Libraries and Constants**
The script begins by importing essential components from the Scapy library. These include sniff for packet capture, Ether for handling Ethernet frames, IP for managing IPv4 packets, and conf for Scapy's configuration settings. Additionally, a protocols dictionary is defined to map protocol numbers to their corresponding names (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), facilitating easier interpretation of captured packet headers.

**Packet Processing Function**
The process_packet function is crucial for dissecting each captured packet. It begins by checking if the packet contains an Ethernet frame (Ether in packet). If true, it extracts and prints details such as the destination and source MAC addresses (eth.dst and eth.src) and the protocol type (eth.type). Subsequently, the function checks for the presence of an IPv4 packet (IP in packet). Upon identification, it retrieves and displays information such as the IP version (ip.version), header length (ip.ihl), Time to Live (TTL) value (ip.ttl), and the specific protocol being used (protocols.get(ip.proto, 'Other')). It also prints the source and target IP addresses (ip.src and ip.dst).

**Main Function**
The main function orchestrates the entire packet sniffing process. It begins by configuring Scapy to use Layer 3 sockets, which is essential for proper operation on Windows systems (conf.L3socket). The sniff function is then invoked with parameters set to:
•	prn=process_packet: Specifies that each captured packet should be processed by the process_packet function.
•	store=False: Ensures that captured packets are not stored in memory, which is beneficial for continuous packet sniffing without overwhelming system resources. The function includes exception handling (try-except) to intercept KeyboardInterrupt events, allowing users to halt the sniffing process gracefully by pressing Ctrl+C.

**Purpose of the Code**
This script serves several purposes within network management and learning environments. Primarily, it acts as a network monitoring tool, providing real-time insights into network traffic patterns and content. It also serves as an educational resource, allowing users to gain practical experience in network packet analysis and protocol interpretation. Furthermore, the script supports network troubleshooting efforts by identifying and examining network anomalies or irregularities in traffic flow.

**Outputs of the Code**
•Ethernet Frame Details: Includes MAC addresses of the packet's source and destination, along with the protocol type.

•IPv4 Packet Details: Provides information on the packet's version, header length, TTL value, protocol type, and source/target IP addresses. These outputs are essential for understanding how data is structured and transmitted across networks, aiding in both diagnostic and educational contexts.
